        <h2>What makes an insperation?</h2>
        <p>An insperation is a person, an obkect, an idea. A point that we can look up to. Insperation can come in many forms, but it takes something very special and so personaly meaningful for a person to be an insperation.</p>
        <p>This past summer I had the privilage to visit the experience the VanGogh Exibition: The Imersive Experience. To say it was an amazing experience would be a masive understatement to the love of the work put into it. I got to read about Van Gogh's life storyand how he felt his art was not good enough to be loved. I share the same feelings about my artwork. To know that a person that talented can feel the same dissapointment in their own work as I do with my own, is an insperation to me.</p>
        <p>Maybe knowing that someone could breakdown in tears over my work like I did watching "Stary Night" wrap around me is all the insperation I need</p>
